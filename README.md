## Chapters

### [Chapter 1: Let There Be a Player](https://aibodh.com/posts/bevy-rust-game-development-chapter-1/)

Learn to build a video game from scratch using Rust and Bevy. This first chapter covers setting up your game world, creating a player character, and implementing movement and animations.

### [Chapter 2: Let There Be a World](https://aibodh.com/posts/bevy-rust-game-development-chapter-2/)

Learn procedural generation techniques to create dynamic game worlds.

### [Chapter 3: Let The Data Flow](https://aibodh.com/posts/bevy-rust-game-development-chapter-3/)

Learn to build a data-driven character system in Bevy. We'll use a RON file to configure character attributes and animations, create a generic animation engine that handles walk, run, and jump animations, and implement character switching.

### [Chapter 4: Let There Be Collisions](https://aibodh.com/posts/bevy-rust-game-development-chapter-4/)

Let's make the player interact with the world properly, no more walking through trees, water, or rocks. We'll implement z-ordering so they can walk behind objects, giving your 2D game true depth. Also, you'll build a collision visualizer for debugging.

### [Chapter 5: Let There Be Pickups](https://aibodh.com/posts/bevy-rust-game-development-chapter-5/)

Build an inventory system to collect items from the world, then zoom in and add smooth camera follow.

### [Chapter 6: Let There Be Particles](https://aibodh.com/posts/bevy-rust-game-development-chapter-6/)

Learn to build a particle system with magical powers and create stunning particle effects. Learn custom shaders, additive blending, and how to make your game feel alive.

## Getting Started

Each chapter has its own directory with a complete, runnable project. Navigate to the chapter directory you want to explore and run:

```bash
cd chapter1  # or chapter2, chapter3, chapter4, chapter5, chapter6
cargo run
```

Note for Linux users on Wayland: if you see rendering artifacts, run the app with the X11 backend:

```bash
WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND=x11 WAYLAND_DISPLAY= cargo run
```
